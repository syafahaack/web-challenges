//----------------------------------------
// QUESTION 6: Has every employee a first name AND a last name?
// Hint: use every()

const everyEmployeeHasFirstAndLastName = employees.every(

  everyEmployeeHasFirstAndLastName
);

//----------------------------------------
// QUESTION 7: Can you find the employee named 'Louise' that is 33 years old?
